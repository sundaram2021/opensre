"""
Upstream/Downstream Pipeline - Orchestration Layer.

Follows Senior/Staff-level refactoring principles:
1. Split domain logic from infrastructure (domain.py).
2. Introduce explicit error types (errors.py).
3. Thin, testable adapters for S3 and Alerting (adapters/).
4. Explicit schemas and contracts (schemas.py).
5. File layout optimized for intent.
